Crisis Event typesL mass shootings, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes

(news articles)
Collection -> Event

Main goal is to generate template or a summary

Tamplate (summary) generation (5W1H - what, where, when, who, why, and how)
These are the three steps that he would like us to take in prototyping
    Manual - offline <- reccomends starting here as a prototype
    Manual - user fills in form that can create a template or a summary that can turn into a summary with place holders ex. <shooter-name> <place> <time>
    automated (using LLM) *****

All event types will have the different templates so hurricanes will have the same template, but it will be different from shootings.

Slot filling

First webpage seen, is login. User logs in, chooses event type that he is interested in
chooses hurricane for example

Nick: How do we add extra information about the crisis that will improve output quality?
Provide a good template that will allow the LLM to fill in those spots. Note, templates shouldn't be very long

Answer: Extra prompt engineering to produce template. Starting point is giving examples
 (prompt: These 3 events, within this category, here are the sample web pages. here is the template, and here is the placeholder)
 IF there is a new event type, user can create template

Use smaller LLM so it can perform, but if there is space we can use the larger one on his server.
Only restriction on LLM is that it needs to perform locally

Slot filling: be able to do it.

Nick showed the Figma wireframe design:
Will need to change the template design to be different than the wireframe
