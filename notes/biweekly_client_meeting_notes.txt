3/5 Client Meeting Notes

Last time asked for a demo and prompt that will generate templates.

Started with showing the client our prompt that is based on o1's optimal prompting.
Returns a json with the summary, we also used the same prompt on Claude and Meta's AI.

Meta did not appear as reliable, and would create tags or not fill them in.

Gemini did not appear to have any issues, these are just visual tests and we don't have a human template to compare and create a grade for.

Asked if we are going to manually change scripts or write a code that will do it for us.

Backend and front end has authentication using Next.js and MongoDB is running using Docker locally.
Nextauth.js uses jwt.

Nick presented Aneesh's webscraping. 

Client said we have made good progress.

Reccommended taking notes in report style of what has been done, or what progress has been made.
For example, Specifically each step of how the prompt was developed over time and improved.

Using docker will be easier to format the db. It will be persistant

Look into langchang, because current webscraping takes way too long.


He requests something that he can actually use and work with next meeting. Preliminary demo that utilizes web scraping
Next meeting March 19th
