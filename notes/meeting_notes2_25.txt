The meeting started around 4 with Nick and Jackson talking about the new Claude 3.7 release

Then conversation started with the use of Google Auth and how we will assign roles when signing up.

-Admin (us developers) can assign roles
-Higher user that can manipulate templates and then base user than can simply generate them
-Hardcode a whitelist, refferal program???
-Key value for users that contains their role and render pages accordingly
(later note secure API endpoints for roles)

Alex and Gibbs assigned working on backend for auth so frontend can get a simple login page working.
Gibbs is going to be away this weekend incl. Friday

Client meeting is next wednesday and he would like to see what we have working with authentication. 
Just some functionality of a webapp and a good prompt for generating templates for a couple event types.
Client specifically asked for a prompt

Our second presentation is on 3/25 and we need to have something to present if we have the above done, that will help
